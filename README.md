**The most recent and modern launcher for Onix Client.**

## Contributing
If there is an issue open with your fix or addition to the launcher, please close it with your pull request. Here are some [good first issues](https://github.com/notcarlton/OnixLauncher/labels/good%20first%20issue) to get you started.

Make sure you follow the [naming convention](https://github.com/notcarlton/OnixLauncher/blob/main/NAMING.md) I've set for the project.

## Packages 
All of these can be found on NuGet under the project tab in Visual Studio.
 - [Guna.UI2.WinForms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Guna.UI2.WinForms/2.0.3.2?_src=template) - WinForms UI library (what makes the interface look really nice)
 - [Microsoft.PowerShell.5.ReferenceAssemblies](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.PowerShell.5.ReferenceAssemblies/1.1.0?_src=template) - Runs PowerShell commands (used to check Minecraft's architecture and version)

## Open source
What you CAN do:
- Modify the launcher for personal use
- Fork the launcher and add some cool features, **without** Onix Client branding
- Submit a pull request with your own additions to the launcher

What you CAN'T do:
- Sell the launcher, even if it's modified
- Modify the launcher and distribute it without credit (no skidding)
- Completely ruin the launcher's design, because I like my design

**We cannot ensure that all forks of the launcher are safe. If a fork does anything dangerous, it's not our problem.**
